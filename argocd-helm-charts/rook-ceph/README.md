# rook-ceph

This includes both of the two upstream rook-ceph charts listed here https://rook.io/docs/rook/v1.10/Helm-Charts/helm-charts/

The upstream chart called "rook-ceph" contains the CRDs and operator (rook) which watches for Ceph CRs
The upstream chart called "rook-ceph-cluster" contains the Ceph CRs that make rook setup Ceph on a cluster
