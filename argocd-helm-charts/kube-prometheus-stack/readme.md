# Prometheus Kubernetes Stack

Includes alertmanager, grafana etc.

## Resetting password for grafana admin user

shell into grafana pod and run:

```bash
grafana-cli admin reset-admin-password <newpassword>
```

## Setup the admin account password

Run the below two command and push the result json file to respective git repo and sync the `secret` app in the argocd

```bash
echo -n 'blahblew' | kubectl create secret generic kube-prometheus-stack-grafana -n monitoring --dry-run=client --from-file=admin-password=/dev/stdin --from-literal=admin-user=admin -o json >grafana_secrets.json

kubeseal --controller-name sealed-secrets --controller-namespace system <grafana_secrets.json >grafana-sealed.json
```

## Troubleshooting

* You have deployed the kube stack and now want to change the password of grafana.

  * You created a sealed secret and pushed it to the git repo and sync'd the secret app in argocd and i
    you can check your password is correct or not in k8s, by this command.

      ```bash
      kubectl get secret  kube-prometheus-stack-grafana -n monitoring -o jsonpath="{.data.admin-password}" | base64 --decode ; echo
      ```

  * The password would be correct, but when you try to login it won't work, why ? cause the stack has already
    deployed the grafana and has no idea how to change the existing password in grafana.

  * oneliner to generate the sealed-secret

      ```bash
      kubectl create secret generic kube-prometheus-stack-grafana -n monitoring --dry-run=client --from-literal=grafana-keycloak-secret=i_love_k8s -o json | kubeseal --controller-name sealed-secrets --controller-namespace system - > sealed-secrets/cluster_name/monitoring/kube-prometheus-stack-grafana.json
      ```

  * To reproduce this, delete the kube stack and run the get secret command and you would see the password is i
    changed to the default one, which it shouldn't.

  * Fix is to simply add the `keys` from the grafana helm chart into the kube stack value file.
      a. one of option is to use the existing secret (so make sure the sealedsecret has deployed the password before)

* Timeout Error while connecting to keycloak

  ```raw
  lvl=eror msg=login.OAuthLogin(NewTransportWithCode) logger=context userId=0 orgId=0 uname= error="Post \"https://keycloak.ops.bw7.io/auth/realms/devops/protocol/openid-connect/token\": dial tcp 10.2.43.194:443: connect: connection timed out"                                                                                    â”‚
  ```

* Relogin does not work as expected. (Happens randomly)

* Currently when you login and logout and login again (it fails here)
* The second login works (confirmed by looking at the logging session in keycloak)
* FIX:
    a. Logout all the session from the keycloak
    b. closed the browser (Now I was testing it in 'Private Mode')
    c. start a new browser and login again
